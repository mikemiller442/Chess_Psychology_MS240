Our dependent variable of interest was whether or not the game was decisive, meaning that one of the players won. In chess 50% of games are drawn, so estimating the probability that the game will be decisive is certainly of interest. We used a logistic regression model that accounts for relevant predictors such as the skill rating gap, the color of pieces they played with, whether or not the move was a popular opening, and the elo of the player with the white pieces.

The independent variable of interest was the record shared between the two players before the match. We found significant evidence that, after accounting for the other predictors, there was a significant relationship between the record between two players and the probability that the game was decisive. This suggests that, even if two players are equally skilled, it is possible for one player to play worse if he or she has underperformed against their opponent in the past.

This project was done with a partner for our Regression Analysis class. We worked together on the C++ script to extract the relevant information from all of the games in the database and format it into tabular form.
